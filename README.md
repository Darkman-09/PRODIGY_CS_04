A simple keylogger is a program that records keystrokes typed on a keyboard. It runs in the background and logs all key inputs into a file, often used for monitoring or spying. While it can be used for legitimate testing, it is also commonly used in cyberattacks to steal data.
üîê Simple Keylogger ‚Äì Description (Long Version)

A simple keylogger is a lightweight program designed to monitor and record every keystroke made on a computer's keyboard. It typically runs silently in the background, capturing user input in real-time and saving it to a log file. This log may include everything typed, such as emails, chat messages, website credentials, and other sensitive information.

Keyloggers are often written in scripting or programming languages like Python, C++, or Java and can be designed to start automatically with the system. They may also hide from the task manager or antivirus detection, depending on how sophisticated they are.
üõ†Ô∏è Common Features of a Simple Keylogger:

    Records all keyboard input

    Saves logs to a local file (e.g., .txt)

    May log timestamps and application names

    Runs in the background (invisible to users)

‚ö†Ô∏è Uses of Keyloggers:

    ‚úÖ Legitimate: Parental control, employee monitoring, usability testing.

    ‚ùå Malicious: Credential theft, identity theft, cyber espionage.

üîê Ethical Note:

While building a keylogger can be educational for cybersecurity or ethical hacking practice, deploying it on any system without consent is illegal and unethical. Always use such tools in legal environments, such as labs or with proper permissions.
